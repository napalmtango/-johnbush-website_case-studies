    weeks of class. The CSS I had written was excessively long
    and complicated. The code, in general needed considerable
    clean upâ€”comments written in a clearer fashion, proper
    indentation, image alt tags, explicit image sizes, semantic
    tags and hosting Google fonts on my server, to name a
    few.
